SiteSnap is built by Sherlock Labs. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and how you can control it. We wrote it in plain English because you shouldn't need a lawyer to understand how your data is handled.

## What We Collect

### Account Information

When you sign up, we collect:

- **Email address** -- to create your account and send you important messages (welcome email, subscription confirmations)
- **Password** (if you use email sign-up) -- stored securely by our authentication provider, Clerk. We never see or store your password directly.
- **Google account info** (if you use Google sign-in) -- only your email and name, through Google OAuth

You can optionally add:

- **Business name** -- displayed on your before/after comparison images
- **Trade type** -- used for your profile (e.g., General, Plumbing, Electrical)

### Photos

When you take or upload a photo in SiteSnap, we store:

- The photo itself (compressed to save bandwidth)
- A smaller thumbnail version (for faster loading in the app)
- The date and time the photo was taken
- The photo type assigned by our AI (before, after, progress, issue, material, measurement)
- A brief description of the photo generated by our AI
- The job the photo belongs to

We do **not** store the GPS location from your photos on our servers. When you share a photo from SiteSnap, GPS metadata (EXIF data) is stripped before sharing.

### Job Information

- Job name and address (address is optional)
- Job status (active or archived)
- When the job was created and last updated

### Usage Data

We collect anonymous usage data to understand how people use SiteSnap and to improve the app. This includes:

- Which features you use (e.g., creating jobs, taking photos, generating comparisons)
- App performance data (load times, errors)
- Device type and operating system version

We do **not** track your physical location, browsing history, or any activity outside SiteSnap.

### Payment Information

If you subscribe to SiteSnap Pro, your payment is handled entirely by Apple through In-App Purchase. We never see or store your credit card number, billing address, or other payment details. Apple sends us a purchase confirmation that tells us your subscription is active -- nothing more.

## Where Your Photos Are Stored

Your photos are stored on Cloudflare R2, a secure cloud storage service. Here is how we protect them:

- **Private by default.** Your photos are never publicly accessible. Every time the app loads a photo, it uses a temporary, time-limited access link that expires after one hour.
- **Encrypted at rest.** Photos are encrypted on Cloudflare's servers.
- **Isolated by account.** Your photos are stored under your unique account identifier. No other user can access them.

## How AI Classification Works

When you take a photo, SiteSnap sends it to Google's Gemini AI service to determine the photo type (before, after, progress, etc.). Here is what you should know:

- The photo is sent to Google's servers for classification and a brief scene description.
- **Google does not keep your photo after processing it.** The image is used only to generate the classification result and is not stored, used for training, or shared by Google.
- The classification result (photo type, confidence score, scene description, detected trade) is stored in our database alongside the photo record.
- If the AI is unsure about a photo, it marks it as "unclassified" and you can assign the type yourself.
- All AI processing happens on our server, not on your phone.

## Third-Party Services

We use a small number of third-party services to run SiteSnap. Each one has access only to the data it needs to do its job.

| Service | What It Does | What Data It Sees |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Clerk** | Handles sign-up, sign-in, and account security | Email address, password (hashed), Google OAuth tokens |
| **Apple** | Processes subscription payments via In-App Purchase | Your Apple ID payment method (we never see this) |
| **Google Gemini** | Classifies your photos by type | Photo images (not retained after processing) |
| **Cloudflare R2** | Stores your photos securely | Photo files and thumbnails |
| **PostHog** | Anonymous usage analytics | Anonymous events (feature usage, no personal data) |
| **Loops** | Sends transactional emails (welcome, subscription confirmation) | Email address and first name |
| **Railway** | Hosts our backend server and database | Account data, job data, photo metadata |

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your personal data or photos with advertisers, data brokers, or any other third parties not listed above.

## Sharing and EXIF Data

When you share a photo or before/after comparison from SiteSnap:

- **GPS metadata is removed.** The shared image has EXIF location data stripped so the recipient cannot see where the photo was taken.
- **Comparison images include your business name** (if you set one) and a small "Made with SiteSnap" watermark.
- Sharing goes through your phone's native share menu. We don't control or track what happens after you share -- that's between you and the app you share to (Facebook, iMessage, etc.).

---

## Data Retention and Deletion

- **Your data stays as long as your account is active.** Photos, jobs, and account information are retained until you choose to delete them.
- **Deleting a job** permanently removes the job and all its photos from our servers. This cannot be undone.
- **Deleting your account** permanently removes all your data -- account information, every job, every photo, and your subscription record. Once deleted, we cannot recover any of it.
- **Canceling your subscription** does not delete your data. Your photos and jobs remain accessible on the free plan.

To delete your account, go to Profile in the app or contact us at the address below.

## Data We Do Not Collect

For clarity, SiteSnap does **not** collect:

- Your physical location or GPS coordinates
- Your contacts or address book
- Your browsing history
- Your text messages or call logs
- Photos outside of SiteSnap (we only access photos you explicitly take or select in the app)
- Biometric data (Face ID / Touch ID is handled by Apple, not by us)

## Children's Privacy

SiteSnap is not designed for or directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe a child has created an account, contact us and we will delete it.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top. For significant changes, we will notify you through the app or by email.
