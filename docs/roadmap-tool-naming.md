# Roadmap Tool — Naming Recommendations

**Author:** Ravi (Creative Strategist)
**Date:** February 11, 2026

## Naming Brief

**What the product is:** A Roadmunk-style strategic roadmap tool with three views (Table, Timeline, Swimlane), real-time collaboration, and presentation-ready exports. Built for product teams managing quarterly planning and strategy communication.

**Competitive landscape:** Roadmunk (now Tempo), Aha!, ProductPlan, Productboard. These names are either literal (ProductPlan), generic (Aha!), or forgettable. There's room for something sharper.

**Name criteria:**
- No "road" or "map" (too close to Roadmunk/Roadmapper)
- 1-2 syllables, max 3
- Works as a verb
- Memorable, professional, modern
- Evokes planning, strategy, visualization, or forward motion

## Top 10 Candidates (Ranked)

### 1. Plot

**Why it works:** This is a double-barreled name. "Plot your strategy" (planning) AND "plot it on a timeline" (data visualization). The word literally means both things the product does — strategic planning and visual charting. It also has a narrative dimension: "the plot" is the story, and roadmaps tell the story of where a product is going. Four letters, one syllable, maximum punch.

**Domain availability:** `plot.com` is likely taken (Plotly may own it). Strong alternatives: `plot.app`, `useplot.com`, `getplot.com`, `plotplan.com`. The `.app` TLD is clean for a SaaS tool.

**In context:**
- "Let me check our **Plot**"
- "I added it to **Plot**"
- "Pull up the **Plot** for Q2"
- "Have you **Plotted** Q3 yet?"
- "Let me **Plot** that out"

---

### 2. Slate

**Why it works:** "To slate" literally means to schedule or plan — "We've slated the launch for March." It also evokes a clean slate (fresh start, blank canvas for planning) and the physical writing surface (a slate board). It sounds authoritative without being aggressive. Professional enough for a boardroom, casual enough for a standup.

**Domain availability:** `slate.com` is taken (Slate Magazine). `slate.app`, `slateplan.com`, `useslate.com` are plausible. `slate.io` worth checking.

**In context:**
- "Let me check our **Slate**"
- "I added it to the **Slate**"
- "Pull up the **Slate** for Q2"
- "We've **Slated** that for next quarter"
- "Let me **Slate** it"

---

### 3. Pave

**Why it works:** You pave the way forward. It implies building the path as you go — active, constructive, forward-looking. Avoids "road" while evoking the same concept of charting a course. It's an action word that feels empowering without being grandiose. Four letters, one syllable.

**Domain availability:** `pave.com` likely taken. `pave.app`, `pavehq.com`, `getpave.com` are strong alternatives.

**In context:**
- "Let me check our **Pave**"
- "I added it to **Pave**"
- "Pull up the **Pave** for Q2"
- "Let me **Pave** that out"
- "We need to **Pave** next quarter"

---

### 4. Stride

**Why it works:** Confident forward motion. A stride is purposeful — it's not wandering, it's not sprinting, it's steady, directed progress. Evokes the rhythm of quarterly planning cadences. Six letters but one syllable — it has weight without being long. Sounds like a product that helps you move with intention.

**Domain availability:** `stride.com` likely taken (Atlassian had a Stride product, now discontinued). `stride.app`, `getstride.com`, `strideplan.com` worth checking. The Atlassian product being dead helps — the name is reclaimed territory.

**In context:**
- "Let me check our **Stride**"
- "I added it to **Stride**"
- "Pull up the **Stride** for Q2"
- "We're in **Stride** for the quarter"

---

### 5. Span

**Why it works:** A span of time. Spanning across quarters. The visual metaphor is perfect — timeline bars literally span from start date to end date. Ultra-short (4 letters), one syllable, and it captures the temporal nature of roadmapping without being literal. It also means to encompass or bridge, which is what a roadmap does between current state and future state.

**Domain availability:** `span.com` likely taken. `span.app`, `spanplan.com`, `usespan.com` are options. `.app` is the natural fit.

**In context:**
- "Let me check our **Span**"
- "I added it to **Span**"
- "Pull up the **Span** for Q2"
- "That feature **Spans** two quarters"

---

### 6. Prism

**Why it works:** A prism splits one beam of light into a spectrum. This product takes one dataset and shows it through three different views — Table, Timeline, Swimlane. The metaphor is uncanny. It also evokes clarity, different perspectives, and the idea that you're seeing the same reality from multiple angles. Five letters, one syllable.

**Domain availability:** `prism.com` likely taken. `prism.app`, `prismplan.com`, `useprism.com` are options. Some existing products use the name but not in the roadmap space.

**In context:**
- "Let me check our **Prism**"
- "I added it to **Prism**"
- "Pull up the **Prism** for Q2"

**Weakness:** Doesn't work as a verb. You can't "Prism it." This is its main limitation versus the top 3.

---

### 7. Trace

**Why it works:** To trace a path. To trace progress over time. It implies following a deliberate route — not wandering, but tracking something with intention. Has a cartographic quality (tracing routes on a map) without literally being "map." Works as both noun and verb.

**Domain availability:** `trace.com` likely taken. `trace.app`, `usetrace.com`, `traceplan.com` are plausible.

**In context:**
- "Let me check our **Trace**"
- "I added it to **Trace**"
- "Pull up the **Trace** for Q2"
- "Let me **Trace** that out"
- "Have you **Traced** the dependencies?"

---

### 8. Forge

**Why it works:** To forge ahead. To forge a plan. There's an industrial strength to it — plans aren't just sketched, they're forged with intention. It implies durability, craftsmanship, and forward momentum. Also works as the place where things are made: "the forge" is where strategy is hammered into shape.

**Domain availability:** `forge.com` likely taken (multiple companies). `forge.app`, `forgehq.com`, `useforge.com` are options. More name competition in this space (GitHub's Gitea fork, etc.).

**In context:**
- "Let me check our **Forge**"
- "I added it to **Forge**"
- "Pull up the **Forge** for Q2"
- "Let's **Forge** the Q3 plan"

**Weakness:** More crowded namespace than Plot or Slate. Multiple companies use "Forge" in tech.

---

### 9. Vela

**Why it works:** Latin for "sail" (also the name of a constellation — the sails of the ship Argo). Sailing metaphors are natural for strategy: setting course, navigating, charting direction. It's distinctive — no one else in the space has this name. Two syllables, four letters. Sounds elegant and international. The constellation angle gives it a "guiding star" quality.

**Domain availability:** `vela.com` may be available (less common word). `vela.app`, `vela.io` worth checking. Higher chance of `.com` availability than more common English words.

**In context:**
- "Let me check **Vela**"
- "I added it to **Vela**"
- "Pull up **Vela** for Q2"

**Weakness:** Doesn't work as a verb. Requires brand-building to establish the association (it's not self-explanatory like Plot or Slate). Could feel pretentious if the product doesn't back it up.

---

### 10. Tack

**Why it works:** In sailing, to tack is to change course strategically — you zigzag against the wind to reach your destination. It's the perfect metaphor for roadmapping: you're not going straight, you're making deliberate shifts in direction to reach strategic goals. Sharp, short (4 letters), one syllable, and completely distinctive in the product management space.

**Domain availability:** `tack.com` might be available. `tack.app`, `usetack.com`, `gettack.com` all plausible.

**In context:**
- "Let me check our **Tack**"
- "I added it to **Tack**"
- "Pull up the **Tack** for Q2"
- "We need to **Tack** on this initiative"
- "Let's **Tack** a new direction"

**Weakness:** The sailing metaphor is subtle — most people know "tack" as thumbtack or tacking something up. The strategic sailing meaning requires some brand education. Could be a strength (unique) or weakness (confusing).

## My #1 Recommendation: Plot

**The pitch:**

Plot is the name. Here's why it's THE one.

Every other roadmap tool is named after what it is (ProductPlan, Roadmunk) or a generic positive word (Aha!). Plot is named after what you *do* with it. And the word does triple duty:

1. **Plot your strategy** — the planning act itself
2. **Plot data on a timeline** — the visualization, the charts, the visual output
3. **The plot** — the narrative, the story of where your product is going

It's four letters. One syllable. It works as a noun ("Check the Plot") and a verb ("Plot it out"). It sounds like what a smart PM says in a meeting: "Let me plot that for you." It's professional without being corporate, short without being cryptic, and memorable without being weird.

The competitive positioning writes itself: **"Every product has a story. Plot yours."**

Or shorter: **"Plot your next move."**

The domain situation is workable. `plot.app` is the natural home for a modern SaaS tool. `useplot.com` and `getplot.com` are backup options. Yes, Plotly exists in the data visualization space, but they're a developer charting library — completely different market, different buyer, different use case. There's no meaningful confusion.

Plot is the kind of name that makes you think "why didn't they think of that first?" That's the sign of a good product name.

## Honorable Mentions (Didn't Make Top 10)

| Name | Why I Cut It |
|------|-------------|
| **Arc** | Great word, but Arc Browser is too prominent right now. Namespace conflict. |
| **Helm** | Kubernetes Helm is a giant in devops. Too much developer mindshare overlap with our target buyer (CTOs, PMs who know Helm = k8s). |
| **Cadence** | Cadence Design Systems is a $70B company. The word is great; the trademark conflict isn't. |
| **Drift** | Negative connotation (drifting off course). Also an existing sales/marketing chatbot company. |
| **Chart** | Chart.js and the general "charting" association makes this too generic. |
| **Draft** | Implies something unfinished — the opposite of what you want for a boardroom-ready roadmap. |
| **Frame** | Decent but flat. Doesn't spark anything. Forgettable. |
| **Pivot** | Overused in startup culture to the point of parody. |
