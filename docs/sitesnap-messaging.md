# SiteSnap -- Product Messaging

**Author:** Priya (Product Marketer)
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** Final
**Audience:** Solo contractors and handypeople. One-truck operations. iPhone users who take 5-15 job site photos a day and can't find any of them later.
**One key message:** Your job photos file themselves. Find any photo from any job in 10 seconds.

## 1. One-Liner Pitch

**"It auto-files your job site photos so you can find any photo from any job in 10 seconds."**

Use this everywhere: Facebook groups, texts, word-of-mouth, DMs, App Store promos, trade show small talk.

Alternate versions for different contexts:

- **For explaining to another contractor:** "It's like if your camera roll organized itself by job. You take the photo, it files it."
- **For the dispute angle:** "Every photo you've taken on the job, filed by job and date. Next time a customer says you didn't finish the work, pull up the proof in 10 seconds."
- **For the Facebook before/after angle:** "Take your before and after photos like you always do. SiteSnap turns them into a side-by-side comparison you can post with one tap."

## 2. App Store Listing

### App Name
**SiteSnap**

Sticking with SiteSnap. It's two syllables, easy to say on a job site, and the name describes what it does. "Snap" = photo. "Site" = job site. Done.

### Subtitle (30 chars max)
`Job Photos, Filed Automatically`

(30 characters exactly)

### Promotional Text (170 chars max)
`Take job site photos. SiteSnap files them by job, date, and type -- automatically. Find any photo in 10 seconds. Create before/after comparisons to share on Facebook.`

(167 characters)

### Description (4,000 chars max)

You've got 6,000 photos on your phone. Half of them are job sites. You can't find any of them.

Last month a customer said you didn't finish the drywall repair. You know you did. You took a photo. But that photo is buried somewhere between your kid's birthday and a screenshot of a supply run list. You scrolled for 10 minutes. Gave up. Ate the $400.

SiteSnap makes sure that never happens again.

HOW IT WORKS

Take photos on the job like you already do. SiteSnap automatically sorts each one -- before, after, progress, issue, materials, measurements. Every photo goes to the right job. No folders. No tags. No typing.

When you need a photo, open the job and it's there. Sorted by date. Labeled by type. Found in 10 seconds.

BEFORE/AFTER COMPARISONS

You already post before-and-afters on Facebook. SiteSnap makes it one tap.

Pick your before photo. Pick your after photo. The app generates a clean side-by-side comparison with your business name on it. Share it straight to Facebook, text it to a customer, or save it to your camera roll.

Your work looks professional. Because it is.

WHAT IT DOES

- Auto-files every photo by job, date, and type
- AI classifies photos as before, after, progress, issue, material, or measurement
- Creates shareable before/after comparison images

- Share any photo or comparison with one tap
- Your business name on every comparison you share

## 3. Facebook Trade Group Post

**Target groups:** Handyman Chat, Contractor Talk, Solo Contractors, Home Remodeling Pros

**Post text:**

Been using this app called SiteSnap for about a week and it's kinda changed how I handle job photos.

You know how your camera roll is a disaster? Every job mixed in with personal stuff, and when a customer says "you didn't do that" you're scrolling for 20 minutes looking for the proof photo?

This thing auto-sorts every photo by job. I take the photo, it files it. Before photos, after photos, progress, materials -- it just knows.

But the thing that sold me: it makes these before/after comparisons with one tap. [ATTACH COMPARISON IMAGE] That's my work. Took me 5 seconds to make that.

Free for your first 10 jobs. $5/month after that if you want unlimited. I figured I'd try it and now I can't go back to scrolling through 6,000 photos.

Not affiliated, just a guy who lost a $400 dispute because I couldn't find the photo. Never again.

**Posting notes for the team:**
- Always attach a real before/after comparison image. The image IS the hook.
- Don't say "check it out" or include a link in the first post. Let people ask for it in the comments. Drives engagement and doesn't look like an ad.
- Reply to "what app is that?" comments with: "SiteSnap. It's on the App Store."
- Vary the job type in each group. Bathroom remodel in a remodeling group. Deck repair in a handyman group. Match the audience.

## 4. Before/After Share Caption

**Default text when sharing from SiteSnap (user can edit before sharing):**

> Another one done. Before and after.

**Alternate suggestions (rotate or let user pick):**

- "That's a wrap on this one."
- "Before and after. Same spot."
- "Start to finish."

**Rationale:** Keep it short and proud. Contractors don't write paragraphs on Facebook. The photo does the talking. The caption just says "look at my work."

---

## 5. Upgrade Prompt Copy

Shown when a free user with 10 active jobs taps "+ New Job."

**Headline:**
All 10 job slots are full.

**Subhead:**
You've got 10 active jobs. Archive a finished job to free up a slot, or go unlimited.

**Value prop bullets:**
- Unlimited active jobs
- Unlimited photos per job
- Keep every job organized and searchable

**CTA Button:**
Go Unlimited -- $5/month

**Dismiss text:**
Not now -- I'll archive a job

**Rationale for the dismiss text:** "Not now" alone feels like a dead end. "I'll archive a job" teaches the user about the free escape valve and keeps them in the product. It's guidance, not guilt.

## 6. Welcome Email (Loops)

**Subject:** Your job photos just got organized.
**Preview text:** Create your first job in 5 seconds.

Hi {firstName},

Welcome to SiteSnap.

Here's all you need to know: create a job, take photos, and the app files everything automatically. Before photos, after photos, progress shots -- sorted by job and date without you lifting a finger.

Three things worth doing first:

1. **Create your first job.** Name it after the customer or address. Takes 5 seconds.
2. **Take a few photos.** SiteSnap classifies them automatically -- before, after, progress, issue, materials, measurements.
3. **Try a before/after comparison.** Pick two photos and the app generates a shareable side-by-side with your business name on it. Post it to Facebook. Watch the comments roll in.

You get 10 active jobs free. Archive finished jobs anytime to free up slots. If you need unlimited, it's $5/month.

That's it. No tutorial. Open the app and start documenting your next job.

-- The SiteSnap team

## 7. Subscription Confirmation Email (Loops)

**Subject:** Unlimited jobs. You're set.
**Preview text:** No more counting. No more archiving.

---

Hi {firstName},

You're on SiteSnap Pro. Unlimited active jobs. Unlimited photos.

No limits to manage. Just create jobs and take photos. Everything files itself like it always has.

Go use it.

-- The SiteSnap team

## 8. Voice & Tone Reference (SiteSnap-Specific)

### Who we're talking to

A skilled tradesperson who takes photos on every job but has no system for organizing them. They're practical. They don't read long descriptions. They decide fast: does this solve my problem, yes or no?

### We sound like

A contractor who found a good tool and is telling a buddy about it. Not a salesperson. Not a tech company.

### We don't sound like

CompanyCam's marketing. No "streamline your workflows." No "team collaboration platform." That's for companies with office managers. We're for the guy in the truck.

### Word Choices

| Use | Don't use |
|-----|-----------|
| photos | media / assets |
| job | project / workspace |
| files itself | auto-organizes / automated classification |
| find | retrieve / access |
| before/after | comparison documentation |
| share | distribute / disseminate |
| your phone | your device |
| $5/month | premium subscription tier |
| job site | work site / field |
| sorts | classifies / categorizes |

### Sentence Rules

- One idea per sentence.
- Active voice always.
- If you write "leverage," "streamline," "optimize," or "empower," delete it and start over.
- Dollar amounts, not words. "$5/month" not "five dollars per month."
- Contractions always. "It's" not "It is." "You'll" not "You will."
- Don't explain the technology. "It sorts your photos automatically" beats "AI-powered classification using multimodal analysis."

## 9. Competitive Positioning

### vs. CompanyCam ($19-49/month)
**Their pitch:** Team photo documentation and collaboration for construction companies.
**Our pitch:** Job photo organization for the guy who works alone. No teams, no complexity, no $19/month.
**One-liner:** "CompanyCam is for crews. SiteSnap is for you."

### vs. Camera Roll (free, default)
**Their pitch:** (none -- it's the default)
**Our pitch:** Your camera roll doesn't know the difference between a job photo and a vacation photo. SiteSnap does.
**One-liner:** "Stop scrolling. Start finding."

### vs. Google Photos / Apple Photos (free)
**Their pitch:** Smart albums, face recognition, location-based grouping.
**Our pitch:** Google Photos groups by "buildings" and "outdoors." SiteSnap groups by "Johnson bathroom remodel, before photo, Feb 12." It knows your jobs because you told it your jobs.
**One-liner:** "Google Photos knows it's a building. SiteSnap knows it's the before photo from the Johnson job."

---

## 10. Screenshot Captions (App Store)

Six screenshots for the App Store listing. Captions for each:

1. **Hero shot (job list home screen):** "Every job. Every photo. One place."
2. **Photo timeline with type badges:** "Before, after, progress -- sorted automatically."
3. **Camera capture with auto-classification:** "Take the photo. We'll file it."
4. **Before/after comparison:** "One tap. Professional before-and-after."
5. **Search across all jobs:** "Find any photo from any job in 10 seconds."
6. **Upgrade prompt / pricing:** "Free for 10 jobs. $5/month for unlimited."
