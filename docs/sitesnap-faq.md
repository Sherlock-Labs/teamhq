## How does SiteSnap organize my photos?

When you take a photo, SiteSnap looks at it and figures out what type it is -- before, after, progress, issue, material, or measurement. It files the photo under whatever job you're currently working on, sorted by date. You don't tag anything. You don't pick a folder. You just take the photo and it's filed.

## Does it work without internet?

You need a connection to upload photos. If your signal drops on a job site, SiteSnap saves the photo and uploads it automatically when your connection comes back. You won't lose any photos because of a bad signal.

## How much does it cost?

SiteSnap is free for up to 10 active jobs with unlimited photos per job. If you need more than 10 active jobs, it's $4.99/month for unlimited. You can archive finished jobs anytime to free up slots on the free plan.

## Can I try it free?

Yes. You get 10 active jobs for free with no time limit. Unlimited photos per job. When a job is done, archive it to free up the slot. You only need to pay if you're running more than 10 active jobs at the same time.

## What happens to my photos if I cancel?

All your jobs and photos stay right where they are. You can still view, search, and share everything. The only thing that changes is the 10-active-job limit comes back. If you have more than 10 active jobs, you won't be able to create new ones until you archive some. Nothing gets deleted.

## Can I share photos with my customers?

Yes. Tap any photo and hit Share. It opens your phone's regular share menu -- text it, email it, post it to Facebook, whatever you need. GPS location data is stripped from shared photos for privacy. For before/after comparisons, the app generates a side-by-side image with your business name on it that you can share the same way.

## Does it work on Android?

SiteSnap is available on iPhone first. Android is coming soon.

## How do I find old photos?

Two ways. You can open any job and scroll through its photo timeline, which is sorted by date with type labels on each photo. Or you can use Search to look across all your jobs at once -- filter by photo type (before, after, issue, etc.), date range, or job name. Either way, you should be able to find any photo in about 10 seconds.

## Is my data private?

Yes. Your photos are stored in a private cloud account that only you can access. They are encrypted and never publicly visible. When SiteSnap sorts a photo, it sends the image to Google's AI service for classification -- Google does not keep your photo after processing it. We don't sell your data to anyone. If you delete your account, all your photos and data are permanently removed. The full privacy policy is available at the support link in the app.

## What if the app sorts a photo wrong?

It happens sometimes, especially with unusual shots. Long-press the type label on any photo and you can change it yourself. The app learns nothing from your correction (it's not that kind of AI), but your photo will be filed under the right type going forward.
