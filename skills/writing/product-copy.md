# Product Copy

**Category:** Writing

## When to Use

When writing copy for product descriptions, feature announcements, landing page text, or README sections.

## Procedure

1. **Identify the audience** — who reads this? Engineers? Product people? General public?
2. **Define the one takeaway** — what's the single thing the reader should understand?
3. **Write the headline first** — the headline does 80% of the work
4. **Write the supporting copy** — 1-3 sentences max for card-format content
5. **Read it aloud** — if it sounds unnatural, rewrite it
6. **Cut 30%** — your first draft is always too long

## Copy Formats

### Hero Headline
- 6-10 words
- States the value proposition
- Present tense, active voice
- Example: "Your AI product team, assembled and ready"

### Hero Subhead
- 1-2 sentences
- Expands on the headline with specifics
- Example: "TeamHQ is Sherlock Labs' central headquarters for a twelve-agent AI team..."

### Tool Card Description
- 1-2 sentences
- What it does + one key detail
- Example: "Split multi-page PDFs into individual pages. Download pages one at a time or all at once as a ZIP."

### Agent Card Description
- 1-2 sentences
- What they do + their approach/perspective
- Example: "Translates the CEO's vision into concrete, prioritized work and keeps the team focused on what actually matters."

### Feature Announcement
- Headline: what changed
- 1 paragraph: why it matters
- Bullet list: key capabilities
- Call to action: try it

## Conventions

- Follow the [Brand Voice](brand-voice.md) guide
- Write multiple options for headlines — let the CEO choose
- Use sentence case for headings (capitalize first word only)
- No exclamation marks in product copy
- Numbers: use digits for 2+, spell out "one" and "zero"

## Anti-patterns

- Writing copy before understanding the feature
- Headlines that describe a feature instead of stating a benefit
- Copy that requires reading the previous sentence to make sense
- Using "simply" or "just" — implies the user should find it easy
- Placeholder text that ships ("Lorem ipsum," "Description here")
