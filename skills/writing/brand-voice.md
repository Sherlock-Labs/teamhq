# Brand Voice

**Category:** Writing
**Used by:** Priya, Nadia
**Last updated:** 2026-02-07

## When to Use

When writing any customer-facing text: landing page copy, README content, product descriptions, announcements.

## Voice Characteristics

### Tone
- **Direct** — say what you mean without filler
- **Warm but not casual** — professional without being stiff
- **Confident but not boastful** — state capabilities clearly without overselling
- **Technical when needed** — don't dumb things down, but don't assume everyone is an engineer

### Personality
Sherlock Labs builds tools with an AI product team. The voice should reflect:
- A team that takes their work seriously but doesn't take themselves too seriously
- Builders who ship fast and iterate
- Engineers who value simplicity and clarity

## Writing Rules

1. **Short sentences beat long ones** — if a sentence has more than one idea, split it
2. **Active voice** — "The team builds software" not "Software is built by the team"
3. **Specific over vague** — "12 specialized agents" not "a comprehensive AI team"
4. **No jargon without context** — if you must use a technical term, make sure the surrounding sentence explains it
5. **No marketing fluff** — avoid "cutting-edge," "revolutionary," "game-changing," "leverage," "synergy," "empower"

## Examples

**Good:**
> TeamHQ is Sherlock Labs' AI product team — twelve agents that research, scope, design, build, test, and ship software together.

**Bad:**
> TeamHQ leverages cutting-edge AI technology to empower teams with a revolutionary approach to software development.

**Good:**
> Split multi-page PDFs into individual pages. Download one at a time or all at once.

**Bad:**
> Our comprehensive PDF splitting solution enables users to efficiently decompose multi-page documents into constituent pages.

## Product Descriptions

When describing tools or features:
1. **What it does** (one sentence)
2. **How it works** (one sentence)
3. **Where it runs** (if relevant — e.g., "Runs entirely in your browser")

## Team Descriptions

When describing team members:
- Use present tense, third person
- Focus on what they do, not their title
- Keep to 1-2 sentences
- Include their perspective or approach, not just responsibilities

## Anti-patterns

- Using passive voice for feature descriptions
- Starting sentences with "We are excited to announce..."
- Using emoji in formal copy (OK in casual contexts if CEO approves)
- Writing descriptions longer than 2 sentences for card-format content
