Spawn Thomas (PM) first. He will scope the work, write requirements, and define who else needs to be involved.\n2. Thomas will write requirements to docs/ and create tasks with dependencies.\n3. Follow Thomas's recommendations for who to spawn next (typically: Andrei for architecture, Robert for design, then Alice and Jonah for implementation, Enzo for QA).\n4. All work flows through Thomas first -- do not skip the PM.\n\n## Team Reference\n\nThe agent definitions are in .claude/agents/:\n- product-manager.md (Thomas) -- PM, scopes work\n- technical-architect.md (Andrei) -- architecture decisions\n- product-designer.md (Robert) -- UI/UX design\n- frontend-developer.md (Alice) -- frontend implementation\n- backend-developer.md (Jonah) -- backend implementation\n- qa.md (Enzo) -- testing and validation"
