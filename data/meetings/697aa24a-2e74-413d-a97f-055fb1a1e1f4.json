  "summary": "The CEO discussed frustrations with the current sequential pipeline approach to multi-agent workflows, where agents pass work like a relay race rather than running in parallel. The interview focused on identifying opportunities to increase team velocity by running more agents concurrently, though the conversation was cut short after just the opening exchange.",
  "keyTakeaways": [
    "The current multi-agent pipeline runs too sequentially — like a relay race with baton passing, which feels slow",
    "The bottleneck isn't individual agent performance but the sequential nature of the workflow",
    "The CEO wants to explore running more agents concurrently to increase throughput",
    "This has been top of mind — the CEO was thinking about it the night before the interview",
    "The core question is: which pipeline steps actually need to be sequential vs. which can safely run in parallel?"

      "description": "The team needs to move from a sequential relay-race pipeline to a more parallel multi-agent workflow",
      "rationale": "The current sequential approach is the primary bottleneck — individual steps aren't slow, but waiting for each to finish before starting the next is",

So is there a way that we can employ more agents at the same time? It just seems like a lot of this stuff is just taking forever. Maybe it's different models? I don't know.",
