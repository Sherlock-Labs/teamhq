      "speaker": "AI Interviewer",
      "role": "Interviewer",
      "text": "That makes sense. To get us started, how are you thinking about the balance between refining our current tools, like the project consolidation work, versus launching entirely new capabilities like the AI-powered interviews?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CEO",
      "role": "Interviewee",
      "text": "Oh, that's a great question. I think right now I'm thinking more about like, how do we grow revenue and how do we launch new products that we can bill for?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AI Interviewer",
      "role": "Interviewer",
      "text": "I see. Focusing on revenue growth and new billable products definitely shifts the priority. Given that, which of the three product ideas from the revenue model—the audio ad stripper, the PDF redactor, or the podcast show notes generator—do you feel has the most potential to hit our targets this quarter?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CEO",
      "role": "Interviewee",
      "text": "That's a great question. I think we've got to lay a lot of foundation. So my ultimate goal is I want to launch 50 new SaaS products this year. And I think whatever one we pick first will just be the first in a long line of them. I think the podcast or MP3 or audio ad stripper, I know that works. I think there's some demand and market for it, maybe not a ton, but I just think that technically we have a pretty good sense of how it works. And I think it could be something that is pretty, I don't know, like I think it could work really well. And yeah, so like I think it's like something that's like technically not super complicated. Get it out the door quickly and maybe learn a little bit about how to set up more and more of these SaaS products really, really fast. So anyway, that's my hope is that like we can kind of just launch and keep the factory moving, so to speak."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AI Interviewer",
      "role": "Interviewer",
      "text": "Right. So the audio ad stripper is less about it being a massive standalone hit and more about testing the factory's ability to ship quickly. If the goal is fifty products this year, what are the specific technical or operational hurdles you're most worried about when it comes to maintaining that kind of pace?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CEO",
      "role": "Interviewee",
      "text": "Yeah, that's a good question. I think the support side could get a little unwieldy, so we'll need to figure that out. I think we have a good game plan on how to do all the infrastructure for billing and SaaS management and invoicing and all that stuff. But yeah, I think that maybe the support side is a little bit of an unknown to me, like how we want to handle that. That'll have to be AI powered because we don't have any humans to really do support if there's support questions. And then like the other thing is just figuring out how we quickly kind of like launch, learn and move on. So like, okay, we launch a new thing, do we give it 90 days and then decide like what to do? Like what's our kind of like general game plan for these things? And then, yeah, like how are we gonna market these things? How are we gonna get them out the door? Like we don't really have any SEO experts on the team. We have not really explored marketing. So how do we wanna handle marketing and kind of all of those things."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AI Interviewer",
      "role": "Interviewer",
      "text": "It sounds like you're weighing the technical ease of launching against some significant unknowns in support and marketing. You mentioned an AI-powered approach for support—is that something you've already decided on as the standard for all fifty products, or are you still open to other ways to handle that volume? Also, when it comes to the ninety-day window you mentioned, what would be the one metric that tells you a product is worth keeping versus moving on from?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CEO",
      "role": "Interviewee",
      "text": "I think ARR, or in this case, I think it would be something like MRR or monthly revenue for each product. And I think after 90 days, if it's not generating, I'd say at least like $100 a month, I think we should have it up for evaluation to kill or at least to shelve for a while just to decrease our operational complexity because invariably we're going to want to do things like data migrations and upgrades. So having tons and tons of products that don't make that much money could just make all of those a lot more complicated than they need to be. So I think that's kind of one of the main considerations. On the support side, I mean, I think that it'll have to be somewhat AI driven. I mean, there's just no way to handle any kind of volume, but it's also something that we can wait on. So we don't need to solve it immediately because we know what happens when you do this and then you can solve it immediately because we have no money and we don't have any users. So we can kind of defer that problem for later."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AI Interviewer",
      "role": "Interviewer",
      "text": "That makes sense to defer the support issue until there is actual volume to manage. You mentioned a one hundred dollar monthly revenue threshold after ninety days as the point where you would evaluate killing or shelving a product to avoid operational bloat. Since you're aiming for fifty products, what are you giving up by choosing to spread your focus across so many small bets rather than doubling down on the first one that hits that one hundred dollar mark?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CEO",
      "role": "Interviewee",
      "text": "I think I'm just making a little bit of a bet that none of the ideas I think that we're going to come up with are going to be huge initially. And so it might just take us throwing a lot of darts at the dartboard to figure out what is worth doubling down on. So that's why I want to just like, let's just go for 50. Let's just like turn out 50 of these things and let's just see what happens. And maybe we find a little bit of a niche somewhere that we start kind of adding on to and kind of see where it takes us."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AI Interviewer",
      "role": "Interviewer",
      "text": "I see. So it's a high-volume strategy to find that one niche worth doubling down on. Since the goal is to keep the factory moving, who on the team is going to own the process of deciding when a product has officially hit its ninety day mark and needs to be evaluated against that one hundred dollar revenue target?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CEO",
      "role": "Interviewee",
      "text": "That should be the product manager, Thomas."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AI Interviewer",
      "role": "Interviewer",
      "text": "Okay, so Thomas will own those evaluation milestones. Let me make sure I'm tracking the key themes here. You're prioritizing revenue growth through a high-volume strategy of launching fifty SaaS products this year, starting with the audio ad stripper because it's technically straightforward. The main goal is to use these small bets to find a niche worth doubling down on, using a ninety-day, one hundred dollar monthly revenue threshold to decide whether to keep or shelve a project. Does that accurately capture your current thinking and the direction for Q1?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CEO",
      "role": "Interviewee",
      "text": "Yeah. And maybe we will lower it. Maybe we'll say 50 bucks by a hundred days or something like that. But I think it's directionally correct. And yeah, I think that those are, those would be like, you know, the, the main goals here is like, let's, I think, I think for Q1, which, you know, we're already at the end of, we're already, you know, beginning of February. So I think by the end of March, I think we should have launched 10 new products."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AI Interviewer",
      "role": "Interviewer",
      "text": "Ten new products by the end of March is an ambitious pace for the rest of the quarter. To make that happen, are there any existing projects, like the TeamHQ redesign or the project consolidation, that you're willing to pause to ensure the team stays focused on these launches? Also, is there anything else on your mind regarding these goals that we haven't touched on yet?"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "CEO",
      "role": "Interviewee",
      "text": "No, I don't think we need to. The project consolidation thing's already done, so I don't think there's other work that needs to go on pause."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "AI Interviewer",
      "role": "Interviewer",
      "text": "Got it, so we're keeping the current momentum while adding this new push. Since we're aiming for ten launches by the end of March and the audio ad stripper is first, what's the second product you want the team to start on to keep that factory line moving?"
