You've been given a new project by the CEO:\n\n## Project: Podcast Show Notes Tool — Competitive Research\n\n**Brief:**\nQuick competitive scan of the podcast show notes tool market — identify top 5 competitors, their pricing models, feature sets, and gaps an indie-focused tool could exploit.\n\nOwner: Suki (Market Researcher)\nPriority: high\nSource: Custom Meeting #3\n\n## Your Job\n\n1. **Scope this project** — write clear requirements for what the research should cover and produce. This is a research project, not a build project, so scope it accordingly. Keep it tight and actionable per the product philosophy (\"enough to act on\").\n\n2. **Write the requirements doc** to `docs/podcast-notes-research-requirements.md`. Include:\n   - Objective (1-2 sentences)\n   - Research questions to answer\n   - Deliverable format (what the output doc should contain)\n   - Acceptance criteria for \"done\"\n\n3. **Create a task file** at `data/tasks/podcast-notes-research.json` tracking this project. Use the standard task format with subtasks. Add it to `data/tasks/index.json`.\n\n4. **After writing requirements, spawn Suki** (market researcher) to do the actual competitive research. She should read your requirements doc and produce `docs/podcast-notes-research.md`.\n\n5. **When Suki finishes, review her output** against your acceptance criteria and report back to the CEO with findings.\n\n## Context\n- Read CLAUDE.md at /Users/jeffsherlock/projects/personal/teamhq/CLAUDE.md for team conventions\n- Read existing task files in data/tasks/ for format reference\n- This is a research-only project — no architecture, design, or build steps needed\n- Pipeline: PM (you) → Suki (researcher) → PM reviews → CEO report\n- Don't ask the CEO for approval before spawning Suki — just do it automatically per CEO preferences","model":"opus","mode":"bypassPermissions","run_in_background":true}}}
