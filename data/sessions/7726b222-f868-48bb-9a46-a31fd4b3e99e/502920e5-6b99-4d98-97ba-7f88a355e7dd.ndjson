Read your agent definition at `.claude/agents/product-manager.md` and the project instructions in `CLAUDE.md` to understand how you operate.\n\n## New Project Assignment\n\n**Project: Podcast Show Notes Tool — Competitive Scan**\n\n**Description:** Quick competitive scan of the podcast show notes tool market. Identify top 5 competitors, pricing models, feature sets, and gaps an indie-focused pay-per-episode tool could exploit.\n\n**Goals:** Validate whether there's a viable gap in the podcast show notes market for a simple, pay-per-episode indie-focused tool.\n\n**Constraints:** Research only — no build. 5 competitors max. Enough to act on, not an exhaustive landscape.\n\n**Brief:** Quick competitive scan of the podcast show notes tool market — identify top 5 competitors, their pricing models, feature sets, and gaps an indie-focused tool could exploit.\n\n**Owner:** Suki\n**Priority:** high\n**Source:** Custom Meeting #3\n\n## Your Job\n\n1. Read your agent definition to understand your role and how you operate\n2. Scope this project — write requirements to `docs/podcast-notes-research-requirements.md`\n3. Since this is research-only (no build), the pipeline is shorter: you scope it, then spawn Suki (Market Researcher) to do the competitive scan and produce `docs/podcast-notes-research.md`\n4. Create a task file at `data/tasks/podcast-notes-research.json` and register it in `data/tasks/index.json`\n5. After Suki delivers, review her output and report back to the CEO with a summary\n\nFollow CLAUDE.md conventions. Don't ask before spawning Suki — just scope the work and hand it off automatically."}}}

This is a quick competitive scan to inform a go/no-go decision — not an exhaustive landscape review.\n\n## Research Questions\n\n1. **Who are the top 5 competitors** in the podcast show notes / AI-generated show notes space?\n2. **What do they charge?** Specifically: subscription vs. pay-per-use, pricing tiers, free tier limits.\n3. **What features do they offer?** Core feature set comparison — transcription, summaries, timestamps, chapters, SEO metadata, social clips, etc.\n4. **Where are the gaps?** What do indie podcasters (solo or small-team, < 10K downloads/episode) struggle with in existing tools?\n5. **Is pay-per-episode viable?** Do any competitors offer this model? If not, is that a gap or a signal that the market doesn't want it?\n\n## Scope\n\n### In Scope\n- Top 5 competitors identified and profiled (name, URL, pricing, core features)\n- Pricing model comparison table\n- Feature comparison matrix\n- Gap analysis: what's missing or underserved for indie podcasters\n- Clear recommendation: is this worth building? If yes, what's the angle?\n\n### Out of Scope\n- Technical architecture or implementation details\n- UI/UX design exploration\n- User interviews or primary research\n- Competitors beyond the top 5 (keep it tight)\n- Podcast hosting platforms that happen to have show notes as a minor feature — focus on tools where show notes generation is the primary or a major feature\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. **Competitor profiles**: 5 competitors, each with name, URL, one-sentence positioning, pricing model, and core feature list\n2. **Pricing table**: Side-by-side comparison of all 5 pricing models, highlighting who offers pay-per-use vs. subscription-only\n3. **Feature matrix**: Comparison across key capabilities (transcription, summaries, chapters, timestamps, SEO, social clips, API access, hosting integration)\n4. **Gap analysis**: 3-5 specific gaps or underserved needs for indie podcasters, with evidence\n5. **Recommendation**: Clear go/no-go recommendation with rationale — one paragraph, not a hedge\n6. **Sources**: Every claim sourced with URL and date accessed\n7. **Deliverable**: Written to `docs/podcast-notes-research.md`\n\n## Constraints\n\n- **Time-boxed**: This should take one research pass. Don't go down rabbit holes.\n- **Bias toward action**: Surface the 3 things that matter, not everything that exists. \"Enough to act on\" is the bar.\n- **Date all findings**: Competitive intelligence has a shelf life. Note when data was gathered.\n\n## Pipeline\n\nThis is a research-only project. Short pipeline:\n\n1. **Thomas (PM)** — scope and requirements (this doc) ✅\n2. **Suki (Market Researcher)** — execute competitive scan → `docs/podcast-notes-research.md`\n\nNo arch, design, build, or QA needed. Suki delivers the research doc, Thomas reviews and reports to CEO.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nThe CEO can read `docs/podcast-notes-research.md` and make a go/no-go decision on building a podcast show notes tool within 5 minutes. The research should make the decision obvious, not leave it ambiguous.\n"}}}

Here's the summary:\n\n## Podcast Show Notes Tool — Competitive Scan Results\n\n**Verdict: GO.** There's a real gap in the market.\n\n### Top 5 Competitors\n| Competitor | Pricing | Model |\n|---|---|---|\n| Castmagic | $29–999/mo | Subscription |\n| Podium | $24/mo + pay-as-you-go | Subscription + credits |\n| Podsqueeze | Free–$89.99/mo | Freemium |\n| Capsho | $99/mo | Subscription |\n| Descript | Free–$50/mo | Freemium |\n\n### Key Insight\n**No one offers clean pay-per-episode pricing.** Every competitor is subscription-based. The $20/month threshold is where indie podcasters drop off — and 85% of indie podcasters aren't monetizing at all.\n\n### 5 Exploitable Gaps\n1. No clean pay-per-episode workflow exists anywhere\n2. Tools are bloated content repurposing suites — podcasters just want show notes\n3. No markdown/plain-text export optimized for hosting platforms\n4. SEO features gated behind expensive tiers\n5. No tool handles \"mentioned links\" resolution well\n\n### Recommendation\nA focused **$2/episode** tool with zero commitment would undercut the market for low-frequency publishers. Andrei estimated a 2–3 day build. Lowest-risk first bet of the three candidates from Meeting #3.\n\n### Risks to Watch\n- Pay-per-episode conversion rate is unvalidated (recommend soft launch with both options)\n- Quality must beat free-tier competitors or the moat is just pricing\n- \"Show notes only\" caps TAM, but right call for v1\n\nAll deliverables are in `docs/podcast-notes-research.md` and `docs/podcast-notes-research-requirements.md`. Ready for your go/no-go call."}}
