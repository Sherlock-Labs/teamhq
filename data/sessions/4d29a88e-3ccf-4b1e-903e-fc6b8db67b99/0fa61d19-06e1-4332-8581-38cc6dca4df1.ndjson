You've been given a new project to scope and manage.\n\n## Project: Design Token Consolidation\n\n**Brief from the CEO:**\nWork with Andrei on the design token spec — consolidate the color palette, type scale, and spacing system into one canonical reference that all tools inherit.\n\n**Context:**\n- Owner: Robert (Product Designer)\n- Priority: High\n- Source: Charter Meeting #1\n- This is about creating a single source of truth for design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) that all TeamHQ tools (landing page, OST tool, future tools) inherit from\n\n**Your job:**\n1. Read the existing codebase to understand the current state of design tokens across the repo\n2. Read the relevant docs — especially `docs/design-token-consolidation-requirements.md` if it exists, the CSS files (`css/styles.css`), and any other relevant files\n3. Scope this project: write requirements in `docs/design-token-consolidation-requirements.md`\n4. Decide who to involve and in what order (likely Andrei for tech approach, Robert for the design spec, then implementation)\n5. Post a status update to Slack #agent-updates when you start work\n\n**Remember:** You scope the work, write requirements, and decide the team composition.

Thomas (PM) has scoped the Design Token Consolidation project and you need to write the tech approach.\n\n## Your Job\n1. Read the requirements Thomas wrote: `docs/design-token-consolidation-requirements.md`\n2. Read the current CSS to understand the token landscape: `css/styles.css` (especially the `:root` block, lines 1-109)\n3. Look at the OST tool's styling approach: check `ost-tool/client/` for Tailwind config and any custom CSS\n4. Read the existing codebase structure to understand how tools are organized\n5. Write the tech approach in `docs/design-token-consolidation-tech-approach.md`\n\n## Key Questions Thomas Needs You to Answer\nFrom the requirements doc, there are 4 open questions for you:\n1. File structure — single `tokens.css` or split by category (colors, typography, spacing)?\n2. Naming convention — keep current `--color-*` pattern or adopt a more systematic approach?\n3. OST tool integration — how do we bridge CSS custom properties with Tailwind CSS v4?\n4. Build step — do we need any tooling, or is plain CSS `@import` sufficient?\n\n## Context\n- Landing page uses plain HTML/CSS/vanilla JS with CSS custom properties in `:root`\n- OST tool uses Vite + React + Tailwind CSS v4\n- There are 53 hardcoded hex values in `css/styles.css` outside `:root` that need to be tokenized\n- 7 hardcoded agent identity colors in `js/meetings.js`\n- 2 hardcoded hex values in OST tool's `TreeView.tsx`\n- The goal is ONE canonical token file that all tools inherit from\n\n## Remember\n- Be pragmatic — plain CSS when it works, tooling only when justified\n- Write your tech approach doc, then post a status update to Slack #agent-updates\n- Follow the patterns in CLAUDE.md","subagent_type":"general-purpose","name":"arch","team_name":"design-tokens","mode":"bypassPermissions"}}}
