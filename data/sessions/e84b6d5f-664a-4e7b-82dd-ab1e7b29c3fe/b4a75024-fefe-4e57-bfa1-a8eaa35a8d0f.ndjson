The CEO has a new project for you to scope and manage through the full pipeline.\n\n## Project: Quick Bug Reporter\n\n**Brief from CEO (Charter Meeting #12):**\nScope a 'quick bug reporter' feature: floating widget with screenshot capture, voice narration, AI transcription, and auto-filing to task tracker as a bug-type task.\n\n**Your job:**\n1. Read CLAUDE.md for full team workflow, conventions, and pipeline details\n2. Read the product-manager agent definition at `.claude/agents/product-manager.md` for your role specifics\n3. Research any existing related code — check the task tracker implementation (recently shipped globally unique task IDs), the projects page, and any relevant patterns\n4. Write a thorough requirements doc at `docs/bug-reporter-requirements.md` covering:\n   - Problem statement and user value\n   - Feature scope (what's in v1, what's deferred)\n   - User flows\n   - Acceptance criteria\n   - Technical constraints/considerations (screenshot capture APIs, voice recording, AI transcription via ElevenLabs or similar, task tracker integration)\n   - File classification for the Proven Pipeline (which files are New, Modify, Restructure)\n5. After writing requirements, continue managing the pipeline — spawn the next agents as defined in CLAUDE.md. Remember Phase 4 is parallel (Robert + BE + Priya all start after Andrei).\n\n**Key context:**\n- This is a TeamHQ feature (not a separate product) — it's a floating widget that lives on TeamHQ pages\n- It should auto-file bugs to the existing task tracker system (globally unique IDs with project prefixes)\n- Voice narration → AI transcription is a key differentiator\n- Screenshot capture should use browser APIs\n- Keep scope tight per Product Philosophy: \"Small bets, shipped fast\"\n\nManage the full pipeline autonomously. Report back to the CEO when the pipeline completes or if you hit a blocker that needs CEO input.","mode":"bypassPermissions"}}}
