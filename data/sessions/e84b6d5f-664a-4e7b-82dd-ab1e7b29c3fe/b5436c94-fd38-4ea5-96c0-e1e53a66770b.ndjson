The CEO has a new project for you to scope and manage through the pipeline.\n\n## Project: Quick Bug Reporter\n\n**Brief from CEO (Charter Meeting #12):**\nScope a 'quick bug reporter' feature: floating widget with screenshot capture, voice narration, AI transcription, and auto-filing to task tracker as a bug-type task.\n\n**Priority:** High\n\n## Your Job\n\n1. **First**, read the CLAUDE.md at `/Users/jeffsherlock/projects/personal/teamhq/CLAUDE.md` and your agent definition at `/Users/jeffsherlock/projects/personal/teamhq/.claude/agents/product-manager.md` to understand the team, pipeline, and your role.\n\n2. **Research phase**: Decide if Suki (market research) and/or Marco (tech research) are needed. Given this involves screenshot capture APIs, voice recording, and AI transcription, Marco's tech research is likely valuable. Spawn researchers if needed.\n\n3. **Scope the work**: Write requirements to `docs/bug-reporter-requirements.md` with:\n   - Problem statement\n   - User stories\n   - Core features (v1 scope — keep it tight per product philosophy)\n   - Acceptance criteria\n   - File classification (New, Modified, Restructure) for early QA notification\n   - Out of scope for v1\n\n4. **Run the pipeline**: After requirements are written, spawn Andrei (Arch) for tech approach. Then manage the rest of the pipeline per CLAUDE.md — Phase 4 parallel tracks (Robert + BE + Priya), then Alice, then reviews, then QA + docs.\n\n5. **Report back** when the pipeline completes or if you hit a blocker needing CEO input.\n\nRemember: Small bets, shipped fast. Scope this to the smallest useful version. A floating widget that captures bugs well is better than a feature-complete bug tracking suite.","name":"pm","model":"opus","team_name":"elegant-bouncing-duckling"}}}
