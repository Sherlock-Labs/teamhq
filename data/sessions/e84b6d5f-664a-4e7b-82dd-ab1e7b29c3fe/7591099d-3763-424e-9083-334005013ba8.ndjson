You have a new project from the CEO (Charter Meeting #12):\n\n## Project: Quick Bug Reporter\n\n**Brief:** Scope a 'quick bug reporter' feature — a floating widget with screenshot capture, voice narration, AI transcription, and auto-filing to task tracker as a bug-type task.\n\n**Priority:** High\n**Source:** Charter Meeting #12\n\n## Your Job\n\n1. **Read CLAUDE.md** at /Users/jeffsherlock/projects/personal/teamhq/CLAUDE.md for full team workflow, conventions, and pipeline rules.\n2. **Read existing project docs** — check docs/ for any existing bug-reporter docs or related work. Check data/tasks/ and data/work-items/ for existing task tracker context.\n3. **Read the current task tracker implementation** — understand how tasks work today (js/tasks.js, the tasks page, data structures) so you can scope the \"auto-filing as bug-type task\" part accurately.\n4. **Write requirements** to `docs/bug-reporter-requirements.md` — scope the smallest useful v1. Remember the product philosophy: small bets shipped fast, simple ideas executed well. This is a floating widget, not a full bug tracking system.\n5. **Create a work item** in `data/tasks/bug-reporter.json` and register it in `data/tasks/index.json`.\n6. **Run the pipeline autonomously** — after writing requirements, spawn the right agents in sequence per CLAUDE.md. Start with Andrei (Arch) for tech approach. Then run Phase 4 in parallel (Robert for design, Jonah/Sam for BE if needed, Priya for marketing). Then Alice for FE. Then reviews. Then QA. Report back to the CEO when complete or if blocked.\n\nKey considerations for scoping:\n- This lives in TeamHQ (the landing page / hub), not a separate repo — it's a feature enhancement\n- Screenshot capture (canvas/dom-to-image approach)\n- Voice narration with AI transcription (which API? ElevenLabs STT is available via MCP)\n- Auto-filing: creates a task in the existing task tracker with type \"bug\"\n- Floating widget UX — where does it live? How does it activate?\n- Keep v1 tight — what's the minimum that's useful?\n\nStart by reading the codebase context, then write requirements and kick off the pipeline."}}}
