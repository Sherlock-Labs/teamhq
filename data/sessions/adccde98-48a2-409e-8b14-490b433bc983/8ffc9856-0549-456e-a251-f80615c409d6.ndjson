The CEO has a new project for you:\n\n## Project: Full QA Audit of All Shipped Projects\n\n**Brief:** Conduct a full QA audit of all five shipped projects (Landing Page, PDF Splitter, PDF Combiner, OST Tool, Task History) covering happy paths, edge cases, responsive behavior, keyboard navigation, accessibility, and error states. Produce a findings report with severity ratings.\n\n**Owner:** Enzo (QA)\n**Priority:** High\n**Source:** Charter Meeting #1\n\n## Your Job\n\n1. Read the CLAUDE.md and your agent definition at `.claude/agents/product-manager.md` to understand your role and the team workflow.\n2. Explore the codebase to understand what the five shipped projects are and where they live.\n3. Write a requirements doc at `docs/qa-audit-requirements.md` that:\n   - Defines the scope of the audit (all five projects)\n   - Lists the test categories (happy paths, edge cases, responsive behavior, keyboard navigation, accessibility, error states)\n   - Defines severity ratings (Critical, High, Medium, Low)\n   - Specifies the deliverable (a findings report)\n   - Sets acceptance criteria\n4. Decide who needs to be involved and in what order. For a QA audit, you likely need Enzo (QA) as the primary executor. Consider whether any other agents are needed.\n5. After writing the requirements doc, message the team lead with your scoping decisions — who to spawn next and what tasks to assign them.\n\nRemember: You scope and prioritize. You don't build — you define what needs to be done and hand it off to the right people.","subagent_type":"general-purpose","team_name":"qa-audit","mode":"bypassPermissions"}}}

Thomas (PM) has scoped a project for you:\n\n## Project: Full QA Audit of All Shipped Projects\n\nYou are conducting a comprehensive QA audit of all five shipped projects in the TeamHQ codebase.\n\n## Your Assignment\n\n1. Read your agent definition at `.claude/agents/qa.md` to understand your role and working style.\n2. Read the requirements doc at `docs/qa-audit-requirements.md` — Thomas wrote this and it defines your full scope.\n3. Explore the codebase to understand each of the five projects:\n   - **Landing Page** — `index.html`, `css/styles.css`, `js/projects.js` (plain HTML/CSS/JS)\n   - **PDF Splitter** — look for it in the repo (likely under a tools/ or similar directory)\n   - **PDF Combiner** — look for it in the repo (likely near PDF Splitter)\n   - **OST Tool** — `ost-tool/` directory (Vite+React frontend, Express backend)\n   - **Task History / Project Management** — the project management features on the landing page + `server/` Express API\n4. Test all five projects across all six QA categories:\n   - Happy paths\n   - Edge cases\n   - Responsive behavior\n   - Keyboard navigation\n   - Accessibility\n   - Error states\n5. For each finding, assign a severity rating using the system in the requirements doc (S1-S4).\n6. Write your findings report to `docs/qa-audit-findings.md` using the format specified in the requirements.\n7. After writing the report, message the team lead with a summary of your findings — total count by severity, any S1/S2 blockers, and your overall pass/fail verdict.\n\n## Important Notes\n- The server needs to be running for project management features. Start it with `npm run dev` from the repo root.\n- PDF tools are client-side only (no server needed).\n- The OST tool has its own dev server in `ost-tool/`.\n- You are doing a CODE AUDIT — read the source code, analyze it for issues, test what you can via code review. You don't have a browser, so focus on code-level QA: reviewing HTML for accessibility attributes, checking JS for error handling, reviewing CSS for responsive breakpoints, etc.\n- Be thorough but practical. Focus on real issues that affect users.","subagent_type":"general-purpose","team_name":"qa-audit","mode":"bypassPermissions"}}}
