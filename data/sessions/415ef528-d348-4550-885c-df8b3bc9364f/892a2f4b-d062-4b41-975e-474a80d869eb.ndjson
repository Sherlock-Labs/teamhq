Create the directory `docs/adrs/`\n2. Write these 7 ADR files, each following the template in the requirements doc (4 sections: Context, Decision, Alternatives Considered, Consequences, plus metadata):\n   - `001-vanilla-js-for-landing-page.md`\n   - `002-express-typescript-for-backends.md`\n   - `003-json-file-storage.md`\n   - `004-client-side-pdf-processing.md`\n   - `005-vite-react-for-interactive-tools.md`\n   - `006-npm-workspaces-for-fullstack.md`\n   - `007-single-file-tools-pattern.md`\n3. Write `docs/adrs/README.md` — an index listing all ADRs with number, title, status, and one-line summary\n\n## Key Guidelines\n- Keep each ADR 20-40 lines. Short and direct.\n- \"Alternatives Considered\" is the most valuable section — be specific about what was evaluated and why it was rejected.\n- Verify your content against the actual tech-approach docs in `docs/` and the project records in `data/tasks.json` and `data/projects/`. Be factually accurate.\n- Use the template format exactly as specified in the requirements doc.\n- Decision maker for all ADRs is \"Andrei (Technical Architect)\"\n- Status for all is \"Accepted\"\n- For dates, use the approximate date from when the project that established the decision was completed, or use 2025-01 as a reasonable default if unclear.\n\n## Reference Material to Read\n- `docs/adr-log-requirements.md` (your requirements)\n- `docs/landing-page-tech-approach.md` (for ADR-001)\n- `docs/ost-tech-approach.md` or similar (for ADR-002, 005, 006)\n- `docs/pdf-splitter-tech-approach.md` and `docs/pdf-combiner-tech-approach.md` (for ADR-004, 007)\n- `data/tasks.json` for project history\n- Any other tech-approach docs in `docs/`\n\nWrite all files and report back when done.","subagent_type":"general-purpose","name":"arch","team_name":"adr-log"}}}
