Write requirements to `docs/adr-log-requirements.md` covering:\n   - What an ADR log is and why we need one\n   - Which past decisions should be documented (at minimum: client-side PDF processing, Express for backends, vanilla JS for landing page, npm workspaces for full-stack tools, JSON file storage, Vite+React for interactive tools)\n   - ADR format/template to use\n   - Where ADRs should live in the repo\n   - Acceptance criteria\n   - Who needs to be involved (Andrei as primary author since he owns architecture decisions, possibly Nadia for documentation standards)\n\n3. After writing requirements, send a message back to the team lead summarizing:\n   - The scope you've defined\n   - Who you recommend involving and in what order\n   - Any phasing recommendations\n\nRemember: This is a LOW priority documentation project.

Here's the summary:\n\n### What He Defined\n\n**7 retrospective ADRs** to document in `docs/adrs/`:\n\n| # | Decision |\n|---|----------|\n| 001 | Plain HTML/CSS for the landing page (no framework) |\n| 002 | Express + TypeScript for all backends |\n| 003 | JSON file storage over database |\n| 004 | Client-side PDF processing (pdf-lib, pdf.js, no server) |\n| 005 | Vite + React for interactive tools, vanilla JS for static pages |\n| 006 | npm workspaces for full-stack tools |\n| 007 | Single-file tools pattern (one HTML file = one tool) |\n\n### ADR Template\nLightweight 4-section format: **Context → Decision → Alternatives Considered → Consequences** plus metadata (status, date, decision maker). No heavyweight RFC process.\n\n### Team Involvement\nOnly **two people** needed (keeping it tight for low priority):\n1. **Andrei** (Technical Architect) — writes all 7 ADRs (he made these decisions)\n2. **Nadia** (Technical Writer) — reviews for clarity and consistency\n\n### Phasing\nSingle phase. Andrei writes → Nadia reviews → Andrei adds CLAUDE.md reference. Done.\n\n### Next Step\nSpawn Andrei to write the ADRs, then Nadia to review. Want me to proceed?"}}
