Let me know. Actually, just go ahead and create a logo, and we'll see what it looks like.\"\n\nKey points from the CEO:\n- Developer-themed aesthetic\n- Leans into terminal/monospace font style\n- They want to see something concrete — not just concepts, but an actual logo\n- Output should be an SVG logo file\n\nThis is a design-focused project. Scope the work, write requirements to `docs/sherlock-logo-requirements.md`, and recommend who should be involved and in what order. \n\nGiven this is a logo/design project (not a full app), think about which team members are actually needed. Not every project needs the full pipeline — Robert (Designer) is obviously key here, and possibly Alice (FE) for SVG implementation, but a backend developer or full QA cycle may not be necessary.\n\nCreate tasks with appropriate dependencies and let the team lead know your plan.","subagent_type":"general-purpose","team_name":"sherlock-logo","mode":"bypassPermissions"}}}
