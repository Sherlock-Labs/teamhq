The CEO wants to create a SherlockLabs logo with a developer-y aesthetic that leans into terminal fonts.\n\nCEO's brief: \"I'd love to create a SherlockLabs logo, something that's kind of developer-y and kind of leans into the terminal font. Let me know. Actually, just go ahead and create a logo, and we'll see what it looks like.\"\n\nYour job:\n1. Read your agent definition at /Users/jeffsherlock/Projects/teamhq/.claude/agents/product-manager.md\n2. Read any existing logo requirements at /Users/jeffsherlock/Projects/teamhq/docs/sherlock-logo-requirements.md if it exists\n3. Scope this work - write requirements to /Users/jeffsherlock/Projects/teamhq/docs/sherlock-logo-requirements.md\n4. This is a logo/branding project, not a typical software feature. Think about what deliverables make sense (SVG logo, different sizes/variants, where it gets used in the codebase).\n5. Decide who needs to be involved. For a logo, you likely need Robert (Designer) to spec the design, and Alice (FE) to implement it as SVG. Andrei (Arch) may not be needed for a pure design deliverable. Use your judgment.\n6. Send a message back to the team lead with your requirements summary and recommended next steps (who to spawn, in what order, task dependencies).","subagent_type":"general-purpose","name":"pm","team_name":"cached-growing-badger"}}}

Thomas will pick it right back up — scope requirements, decide whether to bring in Robert (Designer) for the design spec and Alice (FE) to implement the SVG, and kick off the pipeline. For a logo project, the likely flow is:\n\n1. **Thomas** → requirements (logo variants, sizes, where it's used)\n2. **Robert** → design spec (visual direction, typography, color)\n3. **Alice** → implementation (SVG files, integration into landing page)\n\nReady to restart whenever you are."}}
