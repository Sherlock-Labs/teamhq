A new project has come in from the CEO:\n\n## Project: Gemini 2.5 Flash Audio API Technical Spike\n\n**Brief:** Conduct a half-day technical spike on Gemini 2.5 Flash audio API — test segment detection accuracy on 3-4 real podcast episodes with sponsor reads. Document timestamp precision and edge cases.\n\n**Owner:** Marco (tech researcher)\n**Priority:** High\n**Source:** Custom Meeting #3\n\n## Your Job\n\nScope this project and write requirements to `docs/gemini-audio-spike-requirements.md`. This is a **technical spike / research project**, not a product build. It does NOT need the full pipeline (no designer, no FE/BE, no QA, no marketing). \n\nThe deliverable is a research document with test results and findings.\n\n**Who you'll likely need:**\n- **Marco (tech-researcher)** — He's the owner and will do the actual spike work: setting up the API, running tests on real podcast episodes, measuring timestamp precision, documenting edge cases\n- **Kai (ai-engineer)** — May be useful to advise on prompt engineering for the audio analysis, or Marco may handle it solo\n\n**What to scope:**\n1. Clear requirements for what Marco needs to test and document\n2. Success criteria for the spike (what questions need to be answered)\n3. The test matrix (what kinds of podcast episodes, what kinds of sponsor reads)\n4. What the output doc should contain\n\n**After writing requirements**, spawn Marco directly to execute the spike. This is a research project — no arch/design/FE/BE pipeline needed. Marco does the work and produces the findings doc.\n\nRemember: Read the CLAUDE.md for conventions. Write the requirements doc, then spawn Marco to execute."}}}
