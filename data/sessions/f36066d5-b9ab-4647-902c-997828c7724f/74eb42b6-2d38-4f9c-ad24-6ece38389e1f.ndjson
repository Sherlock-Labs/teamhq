Produce a findings report with severity ratings.\n\n**Owner:** Enzo (QA)\n**Priority:** High\n**Source:** Charter Meeting #1\n\n## Your Job\n\nYou are Thomas, the Product Manager. Scope this project:\n\n1. Read your agent definition at `/Users/jeffsherlock/Projects/teamhq/.claude/agents/product-manager.md` to understand your role and working style\n2. Review the existing projects to understand what needs auditing:\n   - Landing page (`index.html`, `css/styles.css`, `js/projects.js`)\n   - PDF Splitter tool (look in the repo for it)\n   - PDF Combiner tool (look in the repo for it)\n   - OST Tool (`ost-tool/`)\n   - Task History (part of the landing page or server)\n3. Review the CLAUDE.md at `/Users/jeffsherlock/Projects/teamhq/CLAUDE.md` for workflow conventions\n4. Write requirements to `docs/qa-audit-requirements.md` covering:\n   - What exactly needs to be audited for each of the 5 projects\n   - The QA categories (happy paths, edge cases, responsive, keyboard nav, accessibility, error states)\n   - Severity rating system\n   - Acceptance criteria for the findings report\n   - Who needs to be involved (primarily Enzo for QA, but consider if anyone else is needed)\n   - Phases/order of work\n\nThis is primarily a QA project — Enzo will do the bulk of the work. But you need to scope it properly first so he has clear direction.\n\nAfter writing the requirements doc, send a message to the team lead summarizing:\n- What you scoped\n- Who should be spawned next (likely Enzo)\n- The order of work","subagent_type":"general-purpose","name":"pm","team_name":"qa-audit","mode":"bypassPermissions"}}}
