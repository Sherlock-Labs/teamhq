Produce a findings report with severity ratings.\n\n## Your Job\n\nYou are Thomas, the Product Manager. Read your agent definition at `.claude/agents/product-manager.md` and the project CLAUDE.md for full context on how the team operates.\n\nYour job is to:\n1. Scope this project — write requirements in `docs/qa-audit-requirements.md`\n2. Decide who to involve and in what order\n3. Manage the pipeline — spawn the right agents, hand off work, and coordinate\n\nThis is a QA-focused project, so Enzo (QA) will be central.

Here's the summary:\n\n**Findings Report:** `docs/qa-audit-findings.md`\n\n- **32 total findings** (8 retracted as false positives, **24 real**)\n- **S1 (Critical): 0** | **S2 (Major): 7** | **S3 (Minor): 12** | **S4 (Low): 13**\n- **Verdict: PASS (conditional)** — no critical blockers\n\n**The 7 Major (S2) findings:**\n1. OST Tool launch link hardcoded to localhost:5173\n2. PDF Splitter: silent failure on ZIP download (empty catch block)\n3. PDF Splitter: no file size limit — large files could crash browser\n4. PDF Combiner: drag handles not keyboard-accessible\n5. PDF Combiner: no confirmation before \"Clear All\"\n6. OST Tool: no loading timeout/cancel on API calls\n7. OST Tool: no \"Back\" button in multi-step flow\n\n**Cross-project strengths:** HTML escaping, focus-visible styling, consistent responsive breakpoints, semantic HTML, modal accessibility.\n\n**Cross-project weaknesses:** Keyboard drag-and-drop, loading timeouts, large file handling, ARIA state management.\n\nThomas notes that fixing the S2s would be a separate remediation project he'd scope with Andrei (tech approach), Alice/Jonah (fixes), and Enzo (re-validation). Want me to kick that off, or would you like to review the findings report first?"}}
