Read your full agent definition at `.claude/agents/product-manager.md` and the project conventions in `CLAUDE.md` before starting.\n\n## Project Assignment\n\n**Project:** Update tech approach writing practice to explicitly flag files requiring significant restructuring versus simple extension, with a note on downstream impact for QA test planning.\n\n**Owner:** Andrei\n**Priority:** High\n**Source:** Custom Meeting #4\n\n## Your Job\n\n1. Read the existing tech approach skill/template to understand what's currently there. Check `skills/` directory and `docs/` for any existing tech approach templates or guidelines.\n2. Scope this work — define clear requirements and acceptance criteria for updating the tech approach writing practice.\n3. Write the requirements doc to `docs/tech-approach-update-requirements.md`.\n4. Update the task file for this project in `data/tasks/`.\n5. Then run the pipeline autonomously: determine which agents need to be involved and in what order. Since this is a process/documentation update (not a product build), the pipeline may be shorter — use your judgment on which steps are needed.\n\nRemember: You own the full pipeline. Scope it, manage it, and report back to the CEO when it's done or blocked.","mode":"bypassPermissions"}}}
