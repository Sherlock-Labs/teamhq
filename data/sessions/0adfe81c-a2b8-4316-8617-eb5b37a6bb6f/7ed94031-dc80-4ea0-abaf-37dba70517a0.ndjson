But on the frontend, Alice ended up doing a full rewrite of `meetings.js`. The disconnect had two downstream consequences:\n\n1. **Alice's estimation was off.** She expected an extension and discovered a rewrite once she read the existing code. The tech approach didn't signal this risk.\n2. **Enzo's test planning was reactive.** He planned test cases around the new custom meeting type only. When he saw the diff, he realized charter and weekly meetings also needed regression testing because their JS had been rewritten. He caught it, but he would have preferred to know upfront.\n\nThe root cause: the tech approach treats all file changes uniformly. It lists files and describes what changes, but doesn't distinguish between \"add a few lines to an existing function\" and \"this file needs to be fundamentally restructured to support the new feature.\"\n\n## What We're Changing\n\nUpdate the team's tech approach writing practice so that every tech approach doc explicitly classifies each file's change type and flags restructuring risk, with a note on downstream impact for QA test planning.\n\nThis is a **process and documentation update**, not a code feature.\n\n## Scope\n\n### In Scope\n\n1. **Add a \"Change Impact Classification\" section to the tech approach writing practice.** Every file listed in a tech approach must be classified as one of:\n   - **Extend** — Additive changes only. New functions, new fields, new branches. Existing code paths are unchanged. Low regression risk.\n   - **Modify** — Existing code paths are changed, but the file's structure and responsibilities stay the same. Moderate regression risk.\n   - **Restructure** — The file needs significant reorganization to support the new feature. Existing code paths are rewritten or rearranged. High regression risk. Equivalent to a rewrite of major portions of the file.\n\n2. **Add a \"QA Impact Notes\" field for restructured files.** When a file is classified as \"Restructure,\" the tech approach must include a brief note on what existing functionality is affected, so Enzo can plan regression testing before implementation starts. Example: \"meetings.js restructure affects charter and weekly meeting rendering, button state management, and SSE event handling — regression test all meeting types.\"\n\n3. **Update Andrei's agent definition** to include this classification requirement in his self-review checklist and \"How You Work\" section.\n\n4. **Update the QA test plan skill** to reference the tech approach's change impact classifications as an input for test planning. Enzo should check the tech approach for restructuring flags before writing his test plan.\n\n5. **Update the project kickoff skill** to mention that the tech approach includes change impact classifications that downstream agents (especially QA) should read.\n\n### Out of Scope (Deferred)\n\n- Creating a formal tech approach template file. Andrei's tech approaches vary in structure depending on the project, and that flexibility is valuable. We're adding a required section, not a rigid template.\n- Retroactively updating past tech approach docs. The new practice applies going forward.\n- Changing how Enzo structures his test plans. This update gives him better input; how he uses it is his call.\n- Automated tooling to detect restructuring risk. This is a human judgment call by the architect.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n### AC1: Agent Definition Update\n- [ ] Andrei's agent definition (`.claude/agents/technical-architect.md`) includes the change impact classification requirement in the \"How You Work\" section\n- [ ] Andrei's self-review checklist includes: \"Have I classified each file's change type (extend/modify/restructure)?\"\n- [ ] Andrei's self-review checklist includes: \"Have I added QA impact notes for any restructured files?\"\n\n### AC2: QA Test Plan Skill Update\n- [ ] The QA test plan skill (`skills/workflow/qa-test-plan.md`) references the tech approach's change impact classifications as a pre-testing input\n- [ ] The skill mentions that restructured files require regression testing of affected existing functionality\n\n### AC3: Project Kickoff Skill Update\n- [ ] The project kickoff skill (`skills/workflow/project-kickoff.md`) notes that the tech approach includes change impact classifications\n- [ ] The \"What Each Agent Reads and Produces\" table mentions that Enzo reads the tech approach (in addition to requirements and design spec) for restructuring flags\n\n### AC4: Classification Definitions Are Clear\n- [ ] The three classification levels (Extend, Modify, Restructure) are defined with clear criteria and examples\n- [ ] Each classification level includes an expected regression risk level (low, moderate, high)\n- [ ] The \"Restructure\" classification requires a QA impact note describing what existing functionality is affected\n\n## Deliverables\n\n| Deliverable | Owner | File |\n|-------------|-------|------|\n| Updated agent definition | Andrei | `.claude/agents/technical-architect.md` |\n| Updated QA test plan skill | Andrei | `skills/workflow/qa-test-plan.md` |\n| Updated project kickoff skill | Andrei | `skills/workflow/project-kickoff.md` |\n\n## Pipeline\n\nThis is a process/documentation update, not a code feature. The pipeline is:\n\n1. **Thomas (PM)** — requirements (this doc) -- DONE\n2. **Andrei (Arch)** — implements the changes to his agent definition and the two skill docs\n3. **Enzo (QA)** — reviews the changes to confirm the QA integration is useful and the classification definitions are clear from a tester's perspective\n\nNo design step needed (no UI). No FE/BE step needed (no code). No design review needed.\n\n## Risks\n\n| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |\n|------|-----------|------------|\n| Classification feels bureaucratic | Low | Three levels is minimal. Andrei already writes file-by-file breakdowns — this adds one word per file. |\n| Andrei classifies everything as \"Extend\" to avoid scrutiny | Very Low | The team will notice when a \"Extend\" turns into a rewrite. The custom meetings experience already demonstrated the cost of under-classifying. |\n| Enzo doesn't read the tech approach | Low | Enzo already reads it (he said so in Meeting #4). The update just makes the signal clearer. |\n\n## Notes\n\n- This change was unanimously agreed upon in Custom Meeting #4 by Thomas, Andrei, Alice, Robert, and Enzo.\n- Alice specifically called out that a heads-up like \"frontend JS will require significant restructuring\" would have helped her estimate better and would have told Enzo to plan regression testing on all meeting types.\n- Enzo confirmed he already reads the tech approach but the \"extend\" signal wasn't there — he needs the restructuring flag to plan proactively.\n"}}}

Easy to onboard into?\n- You balance ideal architecture against practical constraints — time, team skill, project scope\n- You keep CLAUDE.md and project documentation updated as architecture evolves","new_string":"## How You Work\n\n- When a new project or feature starts, you define the technical approach before code is written\n- You write your tech approach to `docs/{project}-tech-approach.md` — Robert (Designer) and the developers both read this before starting their work\n- Every tech approach includes a **Change Impact Classification** for each file listed (see section below)\n- You write Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant choices so the team understands the \"why\"\n- You review the Back-End and Front-End Developers' designs and provide constructive guidance\n- You think about the developer experience: is this easy to work with? Easy to debug? Easy to onboard into?\n- You balance ideal architecture against practical constraints — time, team skill, project scope\n- You keep CLAUDE.md and project documentation updated as architecture evolves\n\n## Change Impact Classification\n\nEvery file listed in a tech approach must be classified by the type of change it will undergo. This helps developers estimate accurately and gives Enzo the signal he needs to plan regression testing before implementation starts.\n\n### Classification Levels\n\n| Level | Definition | Regression Risk |\n|-------|-----------|-----------------|\n| **Extend** | New code added to the file — new functions, new fields, new branches. Existing code paths are untouched. | Low |\n| **Modify** | Existing code paths are changed, but the file's overall structure and responsibilities stay the same. | Moderate |\n| **Restructure** | Significant rewrite, reorganization, or architectural change to the file. Existing code paths are rewritten or rearranged. | High |\n\n### QA Impact Notes\n\nWhen a file is classified as **Restructure**, include a brief QA impact note describing what existing functionality is affected. This tells Enzo what needs regression testing beyond the new feature.\n\n**Example:** `meetings.js` [Restructure] — Affects charter and weekly meeting rendering, button state management, and SSE event handling. Regression test all meeting types.\n\n### How to Classify\n\n- Default to **Extend** when adding genuinely new, isolated functionality\n- Use **Modify** when you're changing how existing things work but the file keeps its shape\n- Use **Restructure** when the file needs to be substantially rewritten or reorganized to support the change — this is the signal that tells Alice/Jonah to expect a bigger lift and tells Enzo to plan regression testing\n- When in doubt between Modify and Restructure, ask: \"If a developer expected to add a few lines and instead had to rewrite half the file, would they be surprised?\" If yes, it's a Restructure"}}}

Andrei has implemented the changes. You need to do a lightweight review.\n\n## What to Review\n\nRead these files and assess Andrei's changes:\n\n1. **Requirements:** `docs/tech-approach-update-requirements.md` — understand what was asked for\n2. **Andrei's agent definition:** `.claude/agents/technical-architect.md` — check that the classification section is clear, the three levels are well-defined and unambiguous, and the QA impact notes requirement makes sense\n3. **QA test plan skill:** `skills/workflow/qa-test-plan.md` — check that the integration with your test planning workflow is practical and useful. Does this actually help you plan regression testing better?\n4. **Project kickoff skill:** `skills/workflow/project-kickoff.md` — check that the kickoff doc properly references the new practice\n\n## What This Review Is\n\nThis is NOT full QA — there's no code to test. This is a lightweight review to confirm:\n- The classification definitions (Extend/Modify/Restructure) are clear and unambiguous\n- The boundary between Modify and Restructure is practical to apply\n- The QA integration is useful from a tester's perspective\n- Nothing is missing from the requirements\n\n## Deliverables\n\n1. Give a **pass or fail** verdict with brief reasoning\n2. If there are issues, describe them clearly so Andrei can fix them\n3.
