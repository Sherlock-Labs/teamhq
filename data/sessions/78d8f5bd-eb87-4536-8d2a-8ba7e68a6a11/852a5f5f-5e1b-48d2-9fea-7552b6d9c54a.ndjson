Scope this project:\n\n1. First, explore the codebase to understand the current state of design tokens and CSS across all tools (landing page, OST tool, PDF tools, etc.)\n2. Write requirements to `docs/design-token-consolidation-requirements.md`\n3. Decide who to involve and in what order — this is primarily a technical architecture + design project, so Andrei and Robert are likely key players\n4. Report back with your requirements and recommended team/phasing\n\nRead the CLAUDE.md, your agent definition at `.claude/agents/product-manager.md`, and explore the codebase before writing requirements. Look at:\n- `css/styles.css` (landing page styles)\n- `ost-tool/client/src/` (OST tool styles)\n- Any other CSS/style files across the repo\n- Current design patterns and token usage\n\nMake sure to understand the full scope before writing requirements.","subagent_type":"general-purpose","name":"pm","team_name":"design-tokens","mode":"bypassPermissions"}}}
