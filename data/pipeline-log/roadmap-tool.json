        "Bug #3 (portfolio sources mapping) used 'as any[]' cast on portfolioSources because the PortfolioSource type lacks name/color fields that the UI components need. A cleaner fix would define a MappedSource interface, but the cast is pragmatic for v1.",

        "Non-blocking observation: The 'as any[]' cast in the mappedSources useMemo could be replaced with proper typing in a future cleanup pass.",
        "Non-blocking observation: Portfolio view is read-only as specified — clicking items should navigate to source roadmap, but this navigation is not yet implemented (just a console log). This matches the Sprint D requirements which focus on the aggregation view."
