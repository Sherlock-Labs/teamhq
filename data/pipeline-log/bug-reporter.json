        "Analyzed existing work items store and task tracker route to understand integration points",
        "Decided to extend WorkItem schema with 'type' (task/bug/feature) and 'metadata' (key-value) fields — backward-compatible defaults",
        "Wrote 5 user stories covering: widget open, voice recording, AI transcription, submission, screenshot preview",
        "Included interaction state checklists for all 5 stories (loading, error, disabled, empty, timeout)",
        "Specified POST /api/bug-reports endpoint with multipart form data (audio, screenshot, description)",
        "Classified all files: 4 new, 9 modified, 0 restructured — no early QA notification needed",
        "Defined technical constraints: browser support, audio format, screenshot capture, transcription latency targets",
        "Cut aggressive scope: no annotations, no cloud storage, no auth, no mobile, no video, no duplicate detection, no notifications",
        "Tightened recording cap from 60s to 30s — sufficient for bug context, keeps file sizes under 500KB",
        "Removed audio playback control — scope creep, transcription text serves as review",
        "Changed submit requirement: title only is required, description is optional (screenshot + title is a valid bug report)",

        "Add generic 'metadata' field (Record<string, string>) to WorkItem — stores pageUrl, screenshotPath, timestamp for bug reports, reusable for future tools",
        "Single designated 'Bugs' project for v1 — no project picker in the widget. Simpler UX, can add multi-project in v2",
        "Desktop-only for v1 — floating widget doesn't make sense on mobile where screen space is limited",
        "Local filesystem for screenshots — no R2 integration for v1, keeps deployment simple",
        "Include Nina/Soren/Amara in pipeline — floating widget with recording interactions is UI-heavy",
        "Skip Sam (one BE endpoint is not enough for two developers) and skip Priya (internal tool, no marketing)"
