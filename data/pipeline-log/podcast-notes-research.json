        "Researched Podium pricing via WebSearch and third-party sources — $24/mo Creator plan, $6-9/hr pay-as-you-go credits, English-only transcripts on base tier",
        "Researched Podsqueeze pricing and features — confirmed free tier (30 min), $8.99-89.99/mo paid plans, strongest indie offering of incumbents",
        "Researched Capsho pricing — single $99/mo tier (300 min), heavy content marketing focus, AI personas feature",

        "Identified 5 specific feature gaps: (1) no pay-per-episode workflow, (2) over-featured suites for simple use case, (3) no host-optimized markdown export, (4) SEO features gated behind expensive tiers, (5) poor link resolution from audio mentions",

        "Excluded Riverside.fm from top 5 because it's a recording platform that added show notes as a feature, not a show notes tool — different competitive category",
        "Recommended Go based on clear market gap: no pay-per-episode tool exists, all competitors are over-featured content suites at $20+/mo, indie segment is underserved",
        "Flagged pay-per-episode conversion as the key unvalidated assumption — recommended soft launch with both per-episode and bundle options",
        "Flagged show notes quality as table stakes risk — if output quality isn't noticeably better than free-tier competitors, the value prop reduces to pricing alone"
