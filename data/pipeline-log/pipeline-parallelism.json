        "Jonah parallel with Robert is the highest-impact change -- removes an entire phase from backend start time with low risk because API contracts are defined in the tech approach, not the design spec",
        "Priya can start after Thomas's requirements -- messaging is based on product scope, not implementation details. Medium risk of revision if scope changes during build, but scope rarely changes",
        "Nadia can overlap with Enzo -- docs are based on what was built, not whether QA passed. QA fixes rarely change documented behavior",
        "Yuki data collection during QA is low-impact but removes artificial serialization",
        "Alice CANNOT start earlier -- she genuinely needs both the design spec (from Robert) and API contracts (from Andrei/tech approach). This is a true hard dependency",
        "This is a process change only -- requires updates to CLAUDE.md, project-kickoff skill, and Thomas's agent definition. No code changes.",
        "No downstream agents needed -- this is an analysis project, not a build project"
