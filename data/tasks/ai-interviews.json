      "subtasks": [
        "Evaluated Gemini Live API as alternative to ElevenLabs and Vapi — CEO-requested follow-up to earlier tech research",
        "Researched WebSocket-based real-time audio: direct browser-to-API connection, 16kHz PCM input / 24kHz output, 25 tokens/sec, bidirectional streaming",
        "Evaluated Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio model: single-model architecture (no STT+LLM+TTS pipeline), native emotional understanding from raw audio, affective dialogue capabilities",
        "Analyzed pricing: ~$0.025/min + $0.005/session setup = ~$0.76 per 30-min interview vs $3.00 ElevenLabs vs $4.00-10.00 Vapi — 4-6x cheaper than all alternatives",
        "Confirmed free tier availability for development: 10 RPM, 250 RPD on Gemini 2.5 Flash Developer API",
        "Assessed vanilla JS compatibility: vanilla JS demo (gemini-2-live-api-demo) has zero dependencies, uses WebSocket + Web Audio API, perfect fit for TeamHQ's no-framework frontend",
        "Evaluated authentication model: ephemeral tokens for production (1-min validity to connect, 30-min session), API key for development — Express backend generates tokens, frontend connects directly",
        "Researched transcript extraction: built-in input + output transcription via setup config, real-time text chunks, speaker-separated by design (user vs model streams), no multi-format export (raw text only)",
        "Compared knowledge base capabilities: 128k token context window vs ElevenLabs' 5-item limit, system instructions + send_client_content + context caching + function calling for dynamic context",
        "Assessed voice quality: 30 HD voices in 24 languages, good but not ElevenLabs-tier, no custom voice cloning, limited prosody tuning — sufficient for functional CEO interviews",
        "Benchmarked latency: ~320ms p50, ~780ms p95 first token — competitive with alternatives but occasional 7-15s spikes reported by developers",
        "Documented session management: 15-min limit without compression, 10-min connection lifetime, context window compression + session resumption for unlimited duration, resumption tokens valid 2hr (24hr on Vertex AI)",
        "Evaluated concurrency: 50 connections Tier 1, up to 1,000 Tier 2 — more than sufficient for TeamHQ",
        "Confirmed GA status: Live API graduated from preview to GA on both Developer API and Vertex AI in early 2026",
        "Assessed VAD and interruption handling: configurable prefix_padding_ms, silence_duration_ms, disable auto-VAD option, interruption cancels ongoing generation",
        "Evaluated function calling: sync + async modes during conversation, enables mid-interview context retrieval and real-time logging",
        "Mapped integration architecture: Express backend for ephemeral tokens + post-processing, browser connects directly to Gemini WebSocket, transcript assembled client-side and sent to backend on completion",
        "Estimated development effort: 4-5 days (vs 1 day ElevenLabs, 2-3 days Vapi) — additional time for WebSocket management, Web Audio API, session management",
        "Identified key limitations: no audio recording storage, no multi-format transcript export, no custom voice cloning, session management complexity, latency spikes, no embeddable widget, Google deprecation risk",
        "Produced updated comparison matrix across Gemini, ElevenLabs, Vapi, and Retell covering 17 evaluation criteria",
        "Proposed three integration options: (A) Gemini as primary platform, (B) ElevenLabs for fast v1 then migrate, (C) Gemini brain + ElevenLabs voice hybrid"

        "Recommend Gemini Live API as primary platform for v1 — 4-6x cost advantage ($0.76/session vs $3.00-10.00), 128k context window, vanilla JS native compatibility, single-model architecture",
        "Gemini replaces both Vapi (my earlier recommendation) and ElevenLabs (Suki/Thomas recommendation) as the top pick based on pricing breakthrough and GA stability",
        "Voice quality tradeoff is acceptable: Gemini is good but not ElevenLabs-tier — for functional CEO interviews, naturalness gap is tolerable given the cost savings",
        "Development effort tradeoff is justified: 4-5 days vs 1 day (ElevenLabs) is warranted by 4-6x lower operating costs and 25x larger context capacity",
        "Session management is the biggest integration complexity — requires implementing reconnection + context compression that managed platforms handle invisibly",
        "Fallback strategy: if voice quality becomes a user complaint, Option C (Gemini brain + ElevenLabs voice via their Gemini 2.5 Flash integration) provides a hybrid path without architecture changes",
        "Developer API sufficient for v1 — Vertex AI is the upgrade path for enterprise SLAs and data residency if needed later",
        "Audio recording storage is optional for v1 — transcript-only is acceptable, audio capture can be added client-side later"

        "Defined integration approach: interviews are a new MeetingType, reusing existing data/meetings/ storage, MeetingSchema, and meetings list UI",
        "Specified schema changes: add 'interview' to MeetingType enum, add optional recordingUrl and interviewConfig fields",
        "Designed user flow: Interview button in toolbar -> configure topic/context -> start widget inline -> speak with AI -> webhook delivers transcript -> Claude post-processing -> saved as meeting",
        "Defined transcript mapping: ElevenLabs role:agent/user maps to speaker/role fields in TranscriptEntrySchema",
        "Specified two new API endpoints: POST /api/interviews/start and POST /api/webhooks/elevenlabs",
